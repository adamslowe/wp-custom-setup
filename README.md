# wp-custom-setup
This is for public reference only, since people keep asking about my blueprint script. It's not meant to be run as-is and probably won't work for you without significant tweaking.

This is a santized version of my custom wordpress setup & configuration script. API keys and licenses have been removed, so the Script may have syntax errors. 

This is a re-write of an older script, which was created for plesk Apache servers. It's now being used for GridPane OpenLiteSpeed servers and will soon support Nginx. 

The script was originally used to install an Astra/Elementor stack, but now is mainly used for an Oxygen stack. Logic to support plugin "sets" is in its infancy.
